# Optical-Character-Recognition-Using-Tesseract-Engine
This project utilizes Google's Tesseract Engine for text extraction from pdf files and various image formats and converts that text  images to editable and searchable  text. Additionally, it incorporates text to speech functionality through pyttsx3  engine and text translation from one language to another  through Google's Language translation API.
# Hardware 
A computer with a decent processor and enough RAM is crucial for smooth OCR processing. 
For more complex tasks, you might consider a GPU. 
# Software 
• Python 3.x 


• Tesseract OCR Engine 


• Pytesseract library (Python wrapper for Tesseract)


• Image processing libraries (e.g., OpenCV, Pillow) 


• Translation APIs (e.g., Google Translate API, Microsoft Translator API) 


# TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS  
The core technical implementation involves a series of steps that ensure efficient and accurate 
text extraction from images. This process can be broken down into the following key stages: 
• Image Acquisition: Images are acquired from various sources, such as user uploads, 
web scraping, or existing image databases. 


• Image Preprocessing: Images undergo preprocessing to enhance their quality and 
facilitate accurate OCR. This may involve techniques like noise reduction, image 
resizing, and contrast adjustment. 


• Optical Character Recognition (OCR): The Tesseract OCR engine is employed to 
analyze the preprocessed image and identify the characters present within it. 
• Text Extraction: The identified characters are extracted and assembled into words, 
sentences, and paragraphs, forming a readable text format. 


• Translation (Optional): If desired, the extracted text can be translated into other 
languages using a translation API. This enables users to access information in 
different languages.
